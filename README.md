<h1> Hey, I'm Deana (dee-na) ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2> About me :flashlight:</h2>
<p>I started my path in second language education and curriculum development. I believe that everyone should speak/understand at least two languages and that technology can help us make that a reality. <p>
<p>I currently work as a curriculum developer for an online platform for language learning. While working I had been taking classes in Java programing and web application development. I earned an AAS in CIS in 2021. I loved it and decided to pursue a master's in computer science emphasizing software development. I'm currently enrolled in a grad prep program and am working full-time. </p>

<h2> What I love :deciduous_tree:</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>Making second language education more widely accessible and more geared towards how language is acutually aquired. </li>
  <li>Brainstorming new ways to do the above.</li>
  <li>Learning new languages both human and programming. :wink: </li>
 </ul>
